 To run the program, use 'python ./plot.py'

 This will read analyzeLog.yml as configuration file (which depicts which json
 parameter you want to dram plots), and
 xcp.probed_stats.log.json as input file, and generate a few pdf files as the
 result of plot. 

 It will only plot 500 points from the xcp.probed_stats.log.json file( which is
 roughly about ~6hours).  If longer than that,  need to change the file
